	 * Rules The only allowed characters for identifiers are all alphanumeric
	 * characters([A-Z],[a-z],[0-9]), ‘$‘(dollar sign) and ‘_‘ (underscore). For
	 * example “geek@” is not a valid java identifier as it contain ‘@’ special
	 * character. Identifiers should not start with digits([0-9]). For example
	 * “123geeks” is a not a valid java identifier. Java identifiers are
	 * case-sensitive. There is no limit on the length of the identifier but it is
	 * advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only. Reserved Words
	 * can’t be used as an identifier. For example “int while = 20;” is an invalid
	 * statement as while is a reserved word. There are 53 reserved words in Java.
